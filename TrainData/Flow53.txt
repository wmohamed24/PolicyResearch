For US residents, after a Parent has registered a PTC account, TPCI will verify the Parent’s identity by asking for the sum of the first and last digits of the Parent’s social security number and the Parent’s name, date of birth, and street address.  TPCI will not share that information with us.  After TPCI verifies the Parent’s identity, it will ask the Parent to consent to the Child accessing Pokémon GO.
